                                    I have worked with Mahesh at RCOM and had almost regular interactions with him.

                                    In those 3 years, I have seen him not only excel at his basic job responsibility
                                    of Oracle Database Administrator but also being a lively social personality who is
                                    eager
                                    to help others in whatever way he can.

                                    He is found to be a very inquisitive person who is regularly learnings something or
                                    the other
                                    to bring in improvement in the job assigned to him. I have seen his making up as a
                                    finest Oracle DBA
                                    who also gets into query performance tuning even with the background he has.

                                    He works well with the team and in high pressure situation where results and
                                    timelines both are important.
                                    His customer skills are also appreciable.

                                    Wishing him the best career!

                                    One of the most important qualities of a good leader is to smile under huge pressure as well,

                                    but also received love from the society. Robots need to have high IQ and to get work done by humans we need people
